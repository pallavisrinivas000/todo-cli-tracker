# A TODO CLI TASKS TRACKER

This is a python cli program that keeps track of your daily activites .

Used libraries:

1. Rich
2. Typer
3. Sqlite

# What can we do to improve:

1. The update tracker doesn't properly consider the null values.
2. The context manager conn to properly handle commit()
3. Add date of completion in table.
4. We can't undo a complete task back to not done.
